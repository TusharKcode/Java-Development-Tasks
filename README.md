## Basic Task 1: Basic Calculator

### Description
A simple Java console application that performs **basic arithmetic operations** - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division - based on user input.

#### This project demonstrate how to:
- Create and structure a java class with separate methods for each operation. 
- Accept user inputs using the scanner class. 
- Handle invalid inputs and division by zero cases gracefully. 
- Display meaningful output in the console.

---

###  Objectives
- Create a class with methods for each arithmetic operation.
- Take input from the user for numbers and the desired operation.
- Handle edge cases like division by zero.

---

## Basic Task 2 : Number Guessing Game

### Description
A Java console game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user must guess it within a limited number of attempts. 

#### This project demonstrate how to:
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Uses loops and conditionals to check each guess.
- Ends when the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
---
###  Objectives
- Use Java's `Random` class to generate a random number 
- Provide feedback like *"too high"*, *"too low"* or *"correct"*
- Limit the number of attempts
- Handle invalid (non-numeric) inputs

---
## Basic Task 3 :  Factorial Calculation using Recursion

### Description
A Java console application that calculates factorial of a given number using recursion.

#### This project demonstrate how to:
- Implements recursive functions in Java.
- Handles base and recursive cases effectively.
- Manage invalid inputs such as negative numbers.
---
###  Objectives
- Implement a recursive method to compute the factorial. 
- Handle edges cases like factorial of 0 = 1.
- Display appropriate messages for negative numbers or invalid inputs.

---

## Intermediate Task 1 : Employee Management System

### Description
A Java console-based application that manages employee records using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept.
It allows user to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data stored in memory.

#### This project demonstrate how to:
- Create and uses classes and objects in Java.
- Manage data using collections like `Arraylist`.
- Implement CRUD functionality with user interaction via the console.
- Handle invalid inputs and edge cases effectively.

---
### Objectives
- Define an `Employee` class with fields such as ID, Name and Salary.
- Implements methods to Add, View, Update and Delete employee records.
- Use `ArrayList` to store employee data dynamically.
- Apply control structure `loops, conditionals, switch` for user menu navigation.
- Handle invalid or duplicate entries gracefully.

---

## Intermediate Task 2 : File Handling - Reading and Writing to a file

### Description
A Java console-based application that demonstrate file handling by reading data form one text file, processing it (counting line and words) and writing the summary to another file. 

#### This project demonstrate how to:
- Uses Java's `BufferReader` and `BufferWriter` for file I/O operations.
- Read content line by line from an input file.
- Process text to count total lines and words.
- Write the processed summary into an output file.
- Handle file-related exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`.

---
### Objectives
- Read a text file and count the number of lines and words.
- Write the processed output to a new file.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to ensure reliable file operations.
- Display the summary result in the console for quick verification.
