## Basic Task 1: Basic Calculator

### Description
A simple Java console application that performs **basic arithmetic operations** - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division - based on user input.

This project demonstrate how to:
- Create and structure a java class with separate methods for each operation. 
- Accept user inputs using the scanner class. 
- Handle invalid inputs and division by zero cases gracefully. 
- Display meaningful output in the console.

---

###  Objectives
- Create a class with methods for each arithmetic operation.
- Take input from the user for numbers and the desired operation.
- Handle edge cases like division by zero.

## Basic Task 2 : Number Guessing Game

### Description
A Java console game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user must guess it within a limited number of attempts. 

This project demonstrate how to:
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Uses loops and conditionals to check each guess.
- Ends when the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
---
###  Objectives
- Use Java's `Random` class to generate a random number 
- Provide feedback like *"too high"*, *"too low"* or *"correct"*
- Limit the number of attempts
- Handle invalid (non-numeric) inputs
